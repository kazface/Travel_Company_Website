            <p class="daycard_desc_subtitle">Lake Kaindy is a magnificent example of nature's creativity. It is situated within a massive coniferous forest at a height of about 2000 meters above sea level. It was created by a landslide of a large amount of limestone, as well as soil subsidence. The Kolsai lakes (Kulsay) are a series of three lakes in the northern Tien Shan, located in the Kolsai canyon and connected by a jumper between the Kungei-Alatau and Zailiisky Alatau hills. The “pearl of the Northern Tien Shan” are the lakes. The Tien-Shan Spruce lakes are surrounded by lakes. The lakes reach a depth of 50 meters. Rainbow trout are among the flora.</p>

            <p class="daycard_desc_subtitle">The majority of travelers travel to Charyn Canyon as a day excursion from Almaty. This is doable, but it will take four hours to get there and four hours to get back, leaving extremely little time to see the canyons, which are a natural beauty. In such a little period, you can only view the Valley of Castles. We recommend making it a two-day trip to guarantee you get the whole experience: explore at least three canyons, witness sunset and dawn, and camp beneath the stars. You will not be sorry. Make Charyn Canyon part of a wider circle of Almaty Region, starting from Almaty and include Kolsai Lakes and Altyn Emel National Park. Add in the lesser-known Assy Plateau and Turgen Gorge for a fantastic adventure.</p>

            <p class="daycard_desc_subtitle">The mountainous city of Almaty is the financial and cultural capital of Kazakhstan. Walk among the historic fountains, try your luck at winter sports and taste the wild apples that gave the city its name. Visit the high mountain resort of Medeo, Kok-tobe region. In the city you can taste the most delicious traditional cuisine and feel the vibe of the city. </p>
