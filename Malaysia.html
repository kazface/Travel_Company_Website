Your tour of Kuala Lumpur will take you to all of the city's highlights, including the gold-domed King's Palace, the National Monument, and the National Museum, all of which were erected to commemorate Malaysia's independence struggle. Before visiting the peaceful National Mosque, Independence Square or Anglican Church, and the famous KL Tower (with entry to viewing deck) that graces every Malaysian postcard, stock up on gifts in China Town. In Kuala Lumpur, spend the night.</p>
