            <p class="daycard_desc_subtitle">The trip to Amboseli National Park begins early in the morning. Lunch and check-in at the hotel. A game drive in the afternoon. Amboseli National Park is located south of Nairobi. The park is mostly made up of a dry, old lake bed and fragile grassland with patches of acacia forest, with a few tiny, rocky volcanic hills in the south. The environment is rich with yellow barked acacias and phoenix palms around the wetlands of Ol Okenya, Ol Tukai, and Enkongo Narok. Dinner and a night's stay at a campground or resort.</p>

            <div class="line"></div>

            <p class="daycard_desc_subtitle">After breakfast, an optional excursion to a Masai hamlet may be scheduled for good views of Mount Kilimanjaro before clouds build up over the top, with a packed lunch supplied. The singing and dancing that are a part of their everyday life and holy ceremonies are revealed during a visit. It's a moving experience to get a look into their lives and social structures. Despite its shifting environment, Amboseli National Park is perhaps the greatest wildlife place in Africa for viewing elephants up close.</p>

            <p class="daycard_desc_subtitle">Depart early in the morning for Maasai Mara National Reserve, one of the few areas on the planet where wildlife may still be seen in large numbers, as it once did across Africa's plains and woodlands. The Mara supports the magnificent seasonal migration of tens of thousands of wildebeest, zebras, and predators as the northernmost point of the enormous Serengeti ecosystem. </p>
            
            <div class="line"></div>

            <p class="daycard_desc_subtitle">Afternoon game drive after arriving in time for lunch.The reserve is famed for its black-maned lions and rich resident species, and it's one of the few sites in the world where you may view all five of the Big Five on a morning game drive. Many cheetahs are so docile that they seek shade from the sun under a car, and some even climb onto the roof to gain a better view of potential food.</p>
